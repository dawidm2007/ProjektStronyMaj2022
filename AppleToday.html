            In June 2020, at the first ever virtual WWDC, CEO Tim Cook announced the transition from Intel processors to Apple silicon in Macs.

            In September 2020, the iPhone 12, 12 Pro and 12 Pro Max were introduced, being the first iPhones to support 5G.

            In November 2020, the first Mac's with Apple silicon were launched. The Mac mini, MacBook Air and MacBook Pro all featured Apple's M1 chip, itself based on the previous A14 Bionic chip.

            In April 2021, the M1-powered iPad was launched, along with a new M1-powered iMac offered in 7 colors, recalling the 1st generation: Tray-loading|iMacs offered in 5 colors announced in 1999. Apple also launched an iPhone 12 in purple and a GPS tracking device called AirTag that uses the Apple's Find My device network.

            In September 2021, the iPhone 13, iPhone 13 Pro, iPhone 13 Pro Max and iPhone 13 mini were introduced. They didn't change much from the previous iPhone 12.
